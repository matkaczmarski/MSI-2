% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the {PSO-DE Hybrid} on the function $f_{8}$ with restarts for at least 30 seconds and until a maximum budget equal to {$400 (D + 2)$} is reached. The code was run on a {Windows 8 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4500U CPU @ 2.39GHz} with {1} processor and {2} cores. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 equals $1,9e^{-10}$, $2,2e^{-10}$, $2,4e^{-10}$, $3,5e^{-10}$ and $6,1e^{-10}$ seconds respectively.

\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results of \algname\ from experiments according to \cite{hansen2012exp} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2012fun} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:ERTgraphs}, \ref{fig:RLDs}, \ref{tab:ERTloss}, and \ref{fig:ERTlogloss} and in
Tables~\ref{tab:ERTs}.
